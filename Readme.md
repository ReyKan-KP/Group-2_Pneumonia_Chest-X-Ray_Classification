# Pneumonia Chest-X-Ray Classification
 This GitHub repository contains implementations of three deep learning models for classifying chest X-ray images as "Normal" or "Pneumonia." The models include a simple neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a CNN with residual connections. Key features include model development, performance evaluation using accuracy, loss, and validation scores, visual exploration of the dataset, data augmentation using image data generators, and early stopping mechanisms to prevent overfitting. The repository facilitates a comparative analysis of model strengths and weaknesses, contributing to an enhanced understanding of their performance and potential applications in pneumonia detection.
